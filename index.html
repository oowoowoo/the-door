        Test Tubes and Thermometers, Inc. was a seemingly ordinary science supply company, yet it was anything but. Albert Average, a run-of-the-mill office worker with an innate thirst for knowledge, has hopes to soon uncover the secrets of his own workplace. He is a lanky man with a strange smile, often adorned with ill-fitting business clothes, and light-brown stiff hair that never has a strand out of place. Because of his unusual presence, Albert is not highly favored in his workplace by his coworkers. Since almost the entire office decided not to be his friend, the thoughts of what could be hidden in the janitor’s closet were the only thing that had plagued his mind. His boss explained on his first day that the janitor’s closet was strictly off-limits to any employees besides himself

            Albert’s curiosity continues to edge him towards breaking the rules and entering that closet, but his need for employment and fear is what stops him. If he were to lose this job, he would be losing his only source of income. Many would assume that Albert would be thankful to leave this dead-end job and pursue a career in criminal investigation, but he would insist that it was always his dream to work in a small office and market science tools, surrounded by people who don’t like him. Instead, he turns his attention back to his computer and resumes work.

            "Albert, Boss asked for those files from Thursday, do you have them?" The receptionist made her way over to Albert’s desk, looking to him for an answer. Cynthia Stone has been working for the company for about six years, receiving many awards for her receptionist work during that time. Her thick black hair had a soft shine, and was styled into a bob. She often wore business casual clothing with some kind of goth twist, today she donned a suit entirely in black. Cynthia is known to Albert as the only person who treats him half-kindly, and the only accessible person who has knowledge of the closet. After a night of overtime, he spotted her creeping out of the closet very quickly. He had not ever questioned her about this, fearing that it would lose him his job. Today, though, he decided it was the perfect time to bring up such a topic.
