        Test Tubes and Thermometers, Inc. was a seemingly ordinary science supply company, yet it was anything but. Albert Average, a run-of-the-mill office worker with an innate thirst for knowledge, has hopes to soon uncover the secrets of his own workplace. He is a lanky man with a strange smile, often adorned with ill-fitting business clothes, and light-brown stiff hair that never has a strand out of place. Because of his unusual presence, Albert is not highly favored in his workplace by his coworkers. Since almost the entire office decided not to be his friend, the thoughts of what could be hidden in the janitor’s closet were the only thing that had plagued his mind. His boss explained on his first day that the janitor’s closet was strictly off-limits to any employees besides himself

            Albert’s curiosity continues to edge him towards breaking the rules and entering that closet, but his need for employment and fear is what stops him. If he were to lose this job, he would be losing his only source of income. Many would assume that Albert would be thankful to leave this dead-end job and pursue a career in criminal investigation, but he would insist that it was always his dream to work in a small office and market science tools, surrounded by people who don’t like him. Instead, he turns his attention back to his computer and resumes work.
